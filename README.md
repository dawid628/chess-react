# Chess Game
This project was developed as part of the "Multimedia Techniques" course. It is a web application that allows local multiplayer chess game for two players. The application is built using web technologies. Upon launching the application, the user has the option to play a game of chess with another player on the same machine. The interactive chessboard is equipped with buttons for managing the game, such as "New Game", "Undo Move", "Save Game", and "Load Game".

## Requirements
- Node.js and npm installed on the local computer.
- Code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom.
- Git installed on the local computer (if the project will be cloned from a remote repository).
- Access to the repository or project code files.

## Getting Started
- Clone the project files to your local computer.
- Navigate to the project directory in the command line or terminal.
- Install project dependencies using the following command:
`npm install`
- Start the React project using the following command:
`npm start`

This will run the local development server and open the React application in the browser on the default port 3000. You can now view and test the React application in the browser.
